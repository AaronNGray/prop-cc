This program implements the query decomposition algorithm 
of Bob Paige and Deepak Goyal for a linear time fragment for Willard's 
relational calculus.

The algorithm is described in ``The Formal Reconstruction and Speedup
of the Linear Time Fragment of Willard's Relational Calculus Subset'',
Deepak Goyal and Bob Paige.  In IFIP TC2 Working Conf. Algorithmic Languages 
and Calculi, Feb 1997.

The program is called 'willard.'  It is quite primitive at this point:
it simply takes a query from the standard input and splits out the immediate
decompositions.  The files data* contain sample inputs.

The system is composed of the following files:

FILE               DESCRIPTION
---------------    -----------
willard-ast.ph     The abstract syntax tree definition
willard-ast.pcc    Pretty printer for the AST
parser.pcc         The parser for the query language
paige.ph           The base class of the query decomposer
paige.pcc          The main algorithm used in the query decomposer
paige-aux.pcc      Auxiliary routines
rename.pcc         Transformation to rename duplicate variable names
phase1.pcc         Transformation to simplify query and construct DNF
phase2.pcc         Transformation to eliminate quantifiers
phase3.pcc         Transformation to eliminate disjunctions
phase4.pcc         Transformation to eliminate conjunctions 
phase5.pcc         Transformation to process simple find/count queries
proj.pcc           Transformation to rewrite projections into existentials
willard.pcc        Main program
